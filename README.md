# godzilla

godzilla is a mutation testing tool for Go package. 

It is stil very much WIP but if you'd like to try it
`go get github.com/hydroflame/godzilla`
`godzilla <PACKAGE>` or just `godzilla` for the current package.

It contains only a few basic mutators as of today but that should get better within a week.
